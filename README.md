#To use

The app will spin up a map with several points dotted around it, as well as a list of all loaded stashpoints. Clicking a stashpoint will bring up further details and "view more" will open a side box with information on the point i.e. opening times, images etc. 

In the sidebar, clicking a stashpoint will take you to its location on the map. 

'Your location' will set the centrepoint to your current location.

Sory by capacity will sort by the highest capacity, Open late will filter to only those open late.
